A very light yet secure implementation for remote procedure calls with
unified interface via ssh (OpenSSH) or plink/plink.exe (PuTTY).

See [pbdRPC vignette](./inst/doc/pbdRPC-guide.pdf) for more details and
applications.


## Usage

```r
library(pbdRPC)

rpcopt_set(user = "snoweye", hostname = "192.168.56.101")
rpc("whoami")

### or

rpc("whoami", user = "snoweye", hostname = "192.168.56.101")
```


## Features
- The above example is completely done in an interactive `R` session.
- The `rpc()` is unified interface. The call is equivalent to
  `ssh snoweye@192.168.56.101 "whoami"` in a Linux-like system and
  `plink.exe snoweye@192.168.56.101 "whoami"` in a windows system,
  provided that `ssh` and `plink.exe` are reachable through the
  environment variable, `PATH`.
- The default communications between the local `R` and the remote server
  (`192.168.56.101` in this case) are encrypted and secure, by default
  using RSA version 2.
- Private and public paired key authentications are supported,
  i.e. login without password.
- Port forwarding is also supported for two way tunneling, both
  local `-L` and remote/reverse `-R`.


## Installation

The package can be installed from the CRAN via the usual
`install.packages("pbdRPC")`, or via the `devtools` package:

```r
library(devtools)
install_github("RBigData/pbdRPC")
```
